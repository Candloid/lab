1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
I said the liberation of all of Palestine, in this generation, is possible,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,640
and that a comprehensive confrontation, or a series of it,

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,880
between the two demographic blocs in the country;

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,000
its people and their invaders,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,160
can pressure the apartheid

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,560
until it [confrontation] collapses it.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,440
However, I would like to add today

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,240
that Israel knows that

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,440
and knows it for 20 years,

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,360
if not since it has been founded.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,000
It is published in Israeli national security conferences

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,800
that was held in Herzliya since the beginning of the century.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,320
It is periodic conferences that are usually attended by prime ministers

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,720
and army leaders.

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,280
You find in there, in verbatim,

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,960
in a report titled:

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,240
"Israel in 2020"

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,640
published in 2000 and I quote:

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,440
"The projections of current demographic growth trends, if persisted,

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,400
threatens the future of Israel as a Jewish state."

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,120
And that "there should be a Zionist demographic policy

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,440
which its consequences assure the Jewish identity of the state of Israel."

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,160
Which is a euphemism for ethnic cleansing.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,440
All you have to do is to follow the Israeli policies

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,040
in the past couple of decades in:

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,560
doubling of settlement, confiscating land

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
destroying homes, building segregation walls, ratifying Nation-State Bill,

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,480
moving the American embassy [to Jerusalem], the Deal of the Century,

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,320
then attempting to displace the people of Jerusalem out of it,

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,760
just to know that it was at the

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,520
brink of those confrontations,

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,240
on May 2021,

34
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,760
of preparing another Nakba (Translator: Catastrophe; Palestinian exodus):

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,240
either gradually by siege and impoverishment,

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,440
or in a one-shot by military action.

37
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,800
Yes. We can win.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,560
That is, exactly, what endangers us.

39
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,480
Our enemy knows that we can [win] and fears us.

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,760
A fearful is more ferocious than the secure and he is getting ready for us.

41
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,040
We need not to make mistakes, squander a possibility, or let a chance slip away.

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,199
So, everyone of us has a role

43
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,640
in increasing our chances of victory and minimize the chances of our defeat.

44
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,960
You, personally, whoever you were and wherever you were,

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,640
[you] have a role that if neglected shall bring woes unto us.

46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,880
and if you have upheld it, then to the victor go the spoils.

47
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,400
I do not only mean this round of war only,

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,200
but rather all the upcoming rounds.

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,800
I mean all the whole entirety of the war;

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,920
the distance between your home's door and Damascus Gate,

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,400
between the soil on your sidewalks

52
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,120
and the gold on the Dome of the Rock.

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,080
If you were between the [Mediterranean] sea and the [Jordan] river,

54
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,240
In Gaza, Jerusalem, the Inside [of Israel], or an unarmed civilian

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,760
confronting the Israeli soldiers at the checkpoints of the West Bank,

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
then you have well done enough.

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
However, if you were a member of the security apparatuses

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,520
Of the Palestinian National Authority,

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,160
then we have the following to say to you:

60
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,800
Look, our brother! You have two options:

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,960
Either you tire Israel

62
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,480
and force it to draw a part of its forces

63
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,360
from the fronts of Gaza and the Inside [of Israel]

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
to the settlements of the West Bank

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,520
so you would weaken the three fronts all together.

66
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,600
Or, you would be the one to guarantee securing its settlements and checkpoints

67
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,320
and relieve it from more than 3 million

68
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,240
and a half a million Palestinian

69
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,480
who are half of our people between the [Mediterranean] sea and the [Jordan] river.

70
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,720
As if you are sending Israeli military

71
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,880
reinforcements to the other two fronts.

72
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,560
That, and if you were interested in the law of wartimes,

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,280
you would already know that the International Law incriminates building settlements

74
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,880
And holds the state inflicting the occupation responsible

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,560
of all the damage that happens to its settlers.

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,680
Because transferring them to an occupied land is a war crime,

77
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,800
and because resisting the people of the land against the occupation is a legitimate right.

78
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,120
You know better

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,960
how the settlers are armed to their teeth

80
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,760
and trained for combat.

81
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,640
Their threat to the security of the Palestinians is unnegotiable.

82
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,280
Nobody expects from you but doing your duty

83
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,560
in defending your people

84
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,800
against everyone who threatens their lives and their properties.

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,560
If you have found [doing this to] the settlements to much

86
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,120
in its high ground, weapons, and fortifications,

87
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,800
then you also know that the International Criminal Court

88
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,760
ruled since 2004 the illegality of the Segregation Wall.

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,640
Now, verily it segregates!

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,440
It segregates the people of the West Bank from the people of Galilee and the coast

91
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,160
So the Israeli police, the IDF, and the extremists would single out

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,120
the Arab communities surrounded by the invaders

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
in Jaffa, Haifa, and others

94
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,560
either in this confrontation or the ones following it.

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,680
This ruling of the court means that knocking down that wall

96
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,120
is legitimate.

97
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,040
Israel is not the only ones that has bulldozers and pickaxes.

98
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,280
The direction to which you are pointing your rifle, Mr. Officer,

99
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,280
is the one that adds to the many of the Palestinian people,

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,680
between the [Mediterranean] sea and the [Jordan] river,

101
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,720
half of it or deprives of half of it,

102
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,360
and adds to the IDF, on all fronts,

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,480
half of it or deprives of half of it.

104
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,560
So decide,

105
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,280
in front of the eyes of your mother, father, sister, and brother;

106
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,040
I mean your direct family members and the rest of your people,

107
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,960
and in front of the eyes of histories:

108
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,720
Where would you want to point your rifle?

109
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,160
To protect your people from the invaders?

110
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
Or to protect the invaders from your people?

111
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,000
If you have chosen the first, then the peoples honor those who protect them.

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you have chosen the second,

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,680
then have you ever heard of invaders who honor those who serve them?

114
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,880
This is about Palestine.

115
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,040
However, for the rest of the countries,

116
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,840
if you were an Arab fighting an Arab,

117
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,600
then put down your weapon, even temporarily.

118
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,160
If you were in an air force fighter roaming

119
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,800
the skies of Yemen and Syria

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,480
and got ordered to strike the homes of the people,

121
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,440
then do not follow the orders.

122
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,400
Remember the similarity between the complexions of your victims

123
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
and the complexions of the people of Gaza.

124
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Then deduce afterwards who would you look like in this analogy.

125
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Know

126
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,680
that there is an Israeli general who smiles

127
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
every time one of us kills his brother.

128
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,880
That general

129
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,920
is not concerned in the disagreement in the Saqifah (Translator: first schism between Sunna and Shia).

130
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,760
and is not interested in a democratic path in our countries,

131
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,240
or the question of secularism and religion.

132
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,360
The bullet has landed in a body of ours

133
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
not his [the Israeli general]

134
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,920
and that is enough for him to smile.

135
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,360
As for the vast majority of us;

136
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
I mean the many unarmed in the east and the west.

137
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,400
Whoever was in a country holding a peace agreement with Israel,

138
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
let him denounce those agreements publicly,

139
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,120
in street if possible.

140
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,840
If cannot, then on social media websites.

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,480
If cannot, then through a written will to his sons.

142
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,400
Or through a flag on the porch of his house.

143
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,480
That is for us to know that we are many

144
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,360
and for our adversaries to know that they are few.

145
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,840
If there was an office or an embassy for the enemy in your country,

146
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,920
take the necessary health and safety measures against the pandemic,

147
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,360
and practice your constitutional right to stand in the street.

148
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,400
Between you and your brother two meters.

149
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,120
You are not crowding. You are not gathering. You are not protesting.

150
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,920
but rather standing alone in the embassy street!

151
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,720
and your brother standing alone!

152
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,920
where the ambassador and his employees have to pass between the two of you,

153
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,640
and between 10,000 man and woman standing like you;

154
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,160
everyone alone!

155
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,960
Whoever his country's conditions and laws allow,

156
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
then [go for] tent camping and sitting-in 

157
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,480
since those embassies have a revenge with tents (Translator: reference on Nakba tents).

158
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,720
If you were in a country where you cannot gather,

159
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,560
then hold it until its time come,

160
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,320
and it will indisputably come,

161
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,680
I tell our comrades (Translator: referencing political left) and our brothers (Translator: referencing political right), personnel and parties:

162
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,080
civilians in their homes or parliament members,

163
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,240
either sham [parliaments] or real,

164
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,480
make the annulment of the Arab agreements

165
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,000
with the apartheid in Israel

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,720
on the top of your agenda

167
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,920
when you have the streets and when you have the reign.

168
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,840
The streets look impossible [to conquer], then it becomes suddenly available.

169
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,040
A revolution looks like a dream,

170
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,400
until it surprises you as a reality of blood and smoke.

171
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,280
If you grasp the opportunity [for revolution], do not waist it as you have waisted other before.

172
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,720
and once bitten, twice shy.

173
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,200
I was in Tahrir Square in 2011

174
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,040
and in 2012

175
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,920
I was then delivering this talk to the rebels

176
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,160
while they were in the Square.

177
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,960
and to the rebels while they were in reign.

178
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,720
Then comes someone to tell me:

179
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,600
"The annulment of the [peace] agreement [with Israel] may lead to a coup d'état."

180
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,039
Imagine!

181
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,999
Remember the saying of the Christ:

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,960
"For whoever wants to save their life will lose it,"

183
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,640
"but whoever loses their life will find it."

184
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,520
Whoever was in the countries that is not in peace with Israel,

185
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,880
then do everything you can.

186
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,480
Our war is a war of Morales.

187
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,520
Maybe a word or a post

188
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,200
would condole the family of a martyr and strengthens the heart of a freedom fighter

189
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,240
and make your people feel, whom the British had isolated from you,

190
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,320
by a map they have unjustly drew,

191
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,720
then the Israelis isolated them [your people] from each other, 

192
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,200
by maps that they continue to draw till today,

193
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
[Make them feel] that they [your people] have a bond and a support.

194
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,120
That they are not two million in Gaza,

195
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,880
and two million in Galilee and the coast,

196
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,920
and three million in the West Bank.

197
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,280
But rather, they are two billion from the [Pacific] ocean to the [Indian] ocean.

198
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,920
Whoever was outside of the Arab and Muslim sphere,

199
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
then let him show to the people

200
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,880
that Israel is an apartheid

201
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,960
and that all the Palestinians,

202
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,400
between the [Mediterranean] sea and the [Jordan] river,

203
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,960
in refugee camps, or in diaspora,

204
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,800
they [the Palestinians] are being punished because they were not born for Jewish mothers

205
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,440
or else they would have been received with lilies in Ben Gurion airport [in Israel].

206
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,640
We do not demand but what all people demand.

207
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,320
For all humans to be equal and that nobody does us injustice by his mother's religion!

208
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,160
Founding a state for us in a small part of Palestine

209
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,000
that is an economical satellite and that is bare in front of Israel

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,640
will not result but in another weak Arab dictatorship,

211
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,720
and it will embolden the apartheid

212
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,640
against whom remains of the Arabs

213
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,360
under the rule of the Israelis.

214
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,800
In conclusion,

215
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,720
If you were an armed Arab,

216
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,880
then point your gun at your enemy, not your brother.

217
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,960
If you were an unarmed Arab,

218
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,160
then take the streets and public squares as your weapon.

219
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,640
Soldiers cannot overpower crowds.

220
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,960
If you were ordered to inflict an injustice, then refuse.

221
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,400
And let it be.

222
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,200
Keep disobeying the commanding unjust until he submits.

223
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,840
Try, try, and try until you can.

224
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,760
Liberating all of Palestine is possible.

225
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,600
Let us make it certain.

226
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,400
A new Nakba,

227
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,520
if our rulers stay unjust

228
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,560
and we stay obedient,

229
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,080
is also possible too.

230
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,840
Let us make it impossible.

231
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,440
There you have the two paths before you, my friend.

232
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,560
Look at your hands,

233
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,840
to the lines in your palms,

234
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,120
and know that you, not anyone else,

235
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,800
will write your omen.

236
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,200
Be ready.

237
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,800
This generation of yours is a generation of resolution.

238
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Let the shame be for another than you.

239
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,320
The ones before you appeased

240
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,120
and got you here.

241
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,560
If you want to elongate your tournament,

242
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
then listen to your tormentors.

243
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,440
But if you wanted victory,

244
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
there!

245
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,640
Extend your hands.

246
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,160
Nobody takes it but you!
