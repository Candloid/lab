1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
If you hear someone demanding the
establishment of a Palestinian state

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,640
on the borders of the 4th of June 1967 borders,

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,000
with Eastern Jerusalem as its capital,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,840
leading to negotiations with Israel,

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,880
then think a little bit before you
agree with what you have just heard.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,480
Even linguistically,

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,840
Listen and pay attention.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,520
The talk is about a state that
its borders were drawn

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,160
by the the wars of 1948 and 1976.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,200
The first war armistice line produced the map,

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,640
and the second war produced the
acceptance of your rulers of it;

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,120
a country whose borders
were drawn by two defeats

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,920
that invites you to a trade:

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
accept your first defeat and we
will absolve you from the second.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,840
A country that was designed by
your enemy’s weapon twice.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,880
Just like a sculpturer with a chisel

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,680
and a potter with clay.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,040
The matter is beyond refusing

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,960
to have a country of your
own bordered by defeats.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,760
The establishment of a Palestinian state

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,800
on the boarders of one day before the Naksa
(Translator: lit. the Setback. A.k.a. the Six-Day War)

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,000
ensures an eternal perpetuation of Naksa.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,240
It will be a militarily fragile state

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,680
and an economic satellite to Israel.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,360
Everyone who rules it is obliged to

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
be an occupation proxy;

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,080
to take its place

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,280
and do its works.

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,480
Either that,

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,920
or to collapse.

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,960
If you doubt, look at the map.

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,200
This state will be established, theoretically,

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,320
in the West Bank and in Gaza.

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,520
The West Bank will be the largest of its regions

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,880
and the political and the economical center.

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,080
Accordingly, its interest would be to

37
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,840
protect Israel from any assumed attack

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,160
coming from the eastern front for example.

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,280
Because Israel will prefer that
those battles would be waged,

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,640
if that attack happened,

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,920
in the lands of the Palestinian
state on the hills of the West Bank,

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,800
and not in the narrow costal plain

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,840
that was occupied in 1948

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,880
concentrating most of the immigrants who came

45
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,280
to the Hebrew state.

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,520
Many of us may not know,

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,160
because it is a kind of
an embarrassing information,

48
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,200
that the breadth of that plain in some places,

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,640
i.e. the distance between the hills of
the West Bank and the Mediterranean,

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,080
does not exceed 15km.

51
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,320
You, my friend, can cross Israel

52
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
in two halves from east to west

53
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,080
if you would amble,

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,560
as if you are walking your fiancé,

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,680
in less than three hours.

56
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,440
And in less than 10 minuets in your car.

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,680
And before the wheels of an airplane fold away from the runway.

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
For that, the Palestinian rulers

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,720
who accept to rule a Palestinian

60
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,040
statelet, that would be established in the West Bank,

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,360
will do everything they can

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,040
to have this state of theirs

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,080
as a protection buffer for Israel.

64
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,240
They know that failure

65
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,040
in doing that would necessarily mean

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,880
an Israeli invasion of their land

67
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,280
and the loss of their rule,

68
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,320
even the loss of their lives and
the lives of those who they love. 

69
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,400
Their political interest, but rather the
personal one, would be to protect Israel,

72
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,280
not threating it.

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,600
Furthermore, this Palestinian state

74
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,800
would not only be an isolation
buffer between the Arabs and Israel,

75
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,920
but rather between it itself and its people.

76
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,160
Half of the people of that state:

77
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,240
one third of the West Bank
and two thirds of Gaza also

78
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,200
are refugees.

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,080
They originally come from
Galilee and the coast.

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,960
It must supress the violent actions stemming

81
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,280
from its territories against the Hebrew state.

82
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,240
Otherwise, Israel will have to secure it itself

83
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,040
which threatens the existence of a
Palestinian state all from the beginning too.

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
So, this Palestinian state would be

85
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,240
an ally to Israel

86
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,960
against half of its population

87
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,880
and against whoever wants to resist Israel

88
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
of this Ummah.

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,080
If they would say

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,640
that this country can build strength

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,480
and be a platform to liberate
the rest of Palestine,

92
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,560
then the price of its establishment is

93
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,960
the guarantee of Israel that nothing
of that would ever happen.

94
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,880
There you see the Security Coordination

95
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,440
and the military fragility,

96
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,520
are prerequisites for an autonomy in Palestine.

97
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,080
Let alone a country!

98
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,080
It will not be equipped but with police
weaponry directed at its own people.

99
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,440
Otherwise,

100
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,000
It is armless.

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,560
Even If it would arm, it would
be prone itself to invasion.

102
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,040
Even if it was allowed to be armed,

103
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,360
then how many centuries would it need

104
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,880
to build an industrial basis
to produce arms that would peer

105
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,320
its sponsoring superpowers, not Israel?

106
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,440
If you would say that

107
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,760
it can resist Israel in light arms

108
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,480
in guerrilla warfare style,

109
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,640
I would say that this is
effective and possible.

110
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,880
But it requires the transformation
of the rulers of this state

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
from rulers into freedom fighters.

112
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,440
They should undertake moving
from palaces to caves

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,400
which is rare in rulers.

114
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,800
Even if they would do it, this
means an end of the state

115
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,160
and reverting to the state
to which we started from

116
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,320
before the peace process;

117
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,640
occupation and resistance.

118
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,600
And the economy of this
state would be a satellite

119
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,520
just like the days of direct occupation;

120
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,640
businessmen who buy from Israeli factories

121
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,760
and sell their products in the West Bank

122
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,560
and construction workers behind the Green Line.

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,000
Whereas the poor and the rich
both dependent on Israel.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,600
It [the state] would also depend on
conditional international donations

125
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,400
bound to its peacefulness towards Israel.

126
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,040
The state will promise its people
prosperity if they would surrender,

127
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,200
but that promise will never come true.

128
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,680
Because that state can never be democratic,

129
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,880
while half of its people are refugees
from the coast and Galilee,

130
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,920
and it was not established but in return

131
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,960
of its abdication of their right to return.

132
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,240
If it allowed them to hold fair elections,

133
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,720
then it would be highly probable

134
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,560
for them to come up with a government
that would annul peace treaties

135
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,480
that established the state from the beginning.

136
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,200
Thus, it is must for this
state to be autocratic

137
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,440
without effective elected institutions.

138
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,040
This also means the lack
of monitorship on money

139
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,480
because elected parliaments

140
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,560
were invented, to begin with, to
monitor the governments’ expenditure.

141
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
No money monitorship means

142
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,560
easy and rampant corruption.

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,120
This state will concentrate what it gets

144
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,760
in aid from its international sponsors

145
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,960
in the hands of the few of its rulers

146
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,560
which would further impoverish
the ruled ones and their misery.

147
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,160
Neither can the refugees return to their lands

148
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,640
in the coast and in Galilee,

149
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,760
attain political freedom,

150
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,240
nor would they be rich in a collective bribery

151
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,920
for relinquishing all their rights.

152
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,480
As autocracy leads to corruption
due to the lack of monitorship,

153
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,560
so does the corruption increase autocracy.

154
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,960
For the looters to protect themselves

155
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,480
from the anger of the looted ones.

156
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,320
This state would be another nightmare

157
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,720
just like the many of its
sisters in the Arab World;

158
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,680
a people whose money is looted,

159
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,960
of suppressed voice,

160
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,360
does not choose its rulers,

161
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,120
and its rulers do not protect it.

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
But rather, they protect its invaders from it.

163
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,400
They [the rulers] would tire it
[the people] to protect them [invaders].

164
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,480
The only difference between this state and

165
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,240
the original occupation,

166
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,000
is that this new one

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,920
will be called independence so it would last.

168
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,520
The Two-State solution is essentially

169
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,840
a consecration of apartheid.

170
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,320
Gives the invaders 80% of the land

171
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,840
where they have a strong army,

172
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,920
nuclear armament,

173
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,280
and independent economy.

174
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,280
While giving 20% of the land
only to the invaded ones

175
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,600
with no independent armaments or money.

176
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,360
It would relieve Israel

177
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,040
of half of the Palestinians between the
[Mediterranean] Sea and the [Jordan] River.

178
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,280
It is a solution that confines half of the
population in a fifth of the land

179
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
in return for their neutrality in war and

180
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
for letting down the other half.

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,640
A solution that you see today

182
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,520
while it is still a promise

183
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,080
that is dividing the Palestinians
and tempting some of them

184
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,680
of terms of slavery

185
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,480
that are a little better
than what the others get

186
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,120
so that all would get enslaved.

187
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,200
A solution that practically
deprives the Palestinian people

188
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,400
from the political and military effect

189
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
that is consequent to its majority

190
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,760
between the [Mediterranean]
Sea and the [Jordan] River

191
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,840
making the toppling of apartheid in the country

192
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
immeasurably harder.

193
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,120
The invader is usually tempted by his strength

194
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,760
and deceived by his greed.

195
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,080
Even though the Two-State solution

196
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,600
is the only guarantee

197
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,520
for the apartheid in Israel to stay.

198
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,000
The successive Israeli governments

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,880
are more inclined to the [political] right.

200
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,400
To the extremists and settlers

201
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,840
who covet to annex the West Bank.

202
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,920
It is as if Israel wishes from the
Palestinian National Authority

203
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,280
to serve it without even giving it

204
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,160
the tools necessary for its service.

205
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,800
A nominal independence is a
condition for practical slavery.

206
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,000
Just as practical slavery is a
condition for nominal independence.

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,520
Since Israel does not accept
the Two-State solution

208
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,080
coveting to annex the West Bank
and afraid, at the same time,

209
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,520
of the Palestinian demographic majority between
the [Mediterranean] Sea and the [Jordan] River,

210
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,720
the solution that its leaders discovered today

211
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,760
was the same as the one discovered by their ancestors:

212
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,400
a new Nakba (Palestinian Exodus); expelling
the Palestinians out of the West Bank

213
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,200
either directly or suddenly.

214
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,720
In preparation for that,

215
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,520
Israel is confining the largest number of them

216
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,440
in the least possible area of land

217
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
and annexes the rest.

218
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,120
That was the essence of
the Deal of the Century,

219
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,560
the reason behind applying the Israeli law

220
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,840
on the settlements

221
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,200
considering it as a part of the land of Israel,

222
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,920
[the reason] for the displacement of the
[Arab] people of Jerusalem

223
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,720
and more.

224
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,280
I would say that the Two-State solution

225
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,360
would consecrate autocracy, corruption,
and subjection

226
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,600
in the proposed Palestinian state

227
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,760
along with an apartheid

228
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,960
that seeks religious and
ethnic cleansing in Israel.

229
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,040
It is a solution that elongates the life of
the apartheid in Israel.

230
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,520
But the greed and the conceit of the invaders

231
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,680
made them kill that solution

232
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,440
seeking another Nakba

233
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,240
and take a land without its people.

234
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,040
But, once bitten twice shy.

235
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,840
There you see them incapable of
subjecting Gaza for long years.

236
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
So were they not capable of subjecting Sinai,

237
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Beirut,

238
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,400
Tyre and Sidon,

239
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,360
nor the borderline of the South of Lebanon.

240
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
The arrogant is a loser.

241
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,400
The Israeli right-wing governments

242
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,360
is constantly marching towards
losing this struggle.

243
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,720
And we, if we do not let each other down,

244
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,520
are marching towards victory.

245
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,080
My father used to say:

246
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,320
A man cannot cross a chasm

247
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,720
in two jumps.

248
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,680
Neither can he cross it
while hanging in the air

249
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,280
in two stages.

250
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,960
Watchout for a loss
masquerading as a half victory.

251
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,800
It is not of greed for one to
demand for a complete equality

252
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,400
between him and the people.

253
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,840
But that who accepts

254
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,000
to be half a human,

255
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,320
would become a full scoundrel.

256
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,840
Do not get bluffed.

257
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,960
The page of history is before you.

258
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,000
Sign it as a freeman if you wish,

259
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,760
or as a slave if you wish.

260
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,120
The pen is in your hand.
