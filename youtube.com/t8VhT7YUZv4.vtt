1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,800
The claim of the European Zionist movement that it is more entitled to the ownership of Palestine

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,800
is invalid by all means.

3
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:11,245
The claim is originally biblical.

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:16,675
With all respect to all religions, it is not a historical reference or an international legal document

5
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:19,465
between nations that disagree on it and about it.

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:25,800
Still, if we have arguably agreed with the bible as a historical reference,

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,500
there were other nations in Palestine rather than the Jews people;

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,700
before them, while they were there and after the demise of their reign.

9
00:00:32,885 --> 00:00:37,755
Half of the Torah is about the wars between the Jews and the other half is about the mingling with them

10
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:40,955
to the point where Jews worshipped the gods of those others,

11
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:42,965
and the worship of the others to the God of the Jews.

12
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:46,395
What gives an exclusive priority to the offspring of Jews today,

13
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:49,805
if we arguably agreed that they are their offspring,

14
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:54,075
and not the offspring of other dwellers of ancient Palestine, to its ownership?

15
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:57,635
If we, arguably, agreed to the Jewish priority,

16
00:00:57,785 --> 00:01:00,725
some of them remained on the same religion and got expelled by the Romans

17
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:04,375
after Bar Kokhba revolt in 132 AD

18
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:07,875
and some remained in Palestine

19
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,100
got Christianized, maybe accepted Islam, and got Arabized.

20
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:13,255
So what gives the exclusive right to the ownership of the country

21
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:16,225
to that Jew that left the country, exclusively, and not

22
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:18,925
that did not and became a Christian, then maybe a Muslim, for example?

23
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:22,905
That all, as we aforementioned, based on the assumption that

24
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,685
2,000 years of history is completely

25
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:27,875
void of any conversion of any other non-Jew nations

26
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,100
from outside of Palestine to Judaism

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,885
which makes their offspring today, completely, unrelated to ancient Palestine

28
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:37,195
This assumption is naturally wrong!

29
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:41,855
History is rampant with non-Hebrews to Judaism.

30
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:48,125
It is correct that converting to Judaism is procedurally more complicated than converting to Christianity or Islam,

31
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,505
However, the conversion of nations of other religions to it

32
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:54,575
happened in the past and is happening until today. The evidence is rampant,

33
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:59,725
starting with Yohanan, the high priest, known as Hyrcanus, the ruler of Judea,

34
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:04,015
that forced the conversion of the entire population of Edomites in the second century AD

35
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:08,240
to the writings of Maimonides in the medieval ages about the rules of the conversion of the people to Judaism

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,295
to the point where the daughter of the 45th president of the United States

37
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,300
to Judaism in those times while her grandfathers of her father's side are from Germany and Scottland,

38
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,200
and her grandfathers of her mother's side are from Czech and Austria!

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,080
That is geography-wise,

40
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:28,300
however, historically, what makes the Jew that left [Palestine] or the foreigner that recently embraced Judaism

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,315
more entitled than the Palestinians of the Jewish part of their country?

42
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:37,765
The Zionist European colonialist nationalist movement of the modern age

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
has stolen even its Jewish history

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,595
The Jewish part of the history of Palestine is a part of our history as Palestinians

45
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:47,425
We are the Palestinians, the people country that stayed in it.

46
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:50,515
For however was Jewish, then got Christianized, then become a Muslim

47
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:53,315
or for that how was never Jewish from the beginning

48
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:56,375
and his family was before the Jews, with them, and after them

49
00:02:56,375 --> 00:03:00,278
or those who have come to it of different peoples who shared its people's religions

50
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:03,400
and talked their languages and married from them on the span of thousands of years

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,725
An Arab Palestinian person with his forefathers from Quresh (Family of Prophet Mohammad) for example

52
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:10,525
could have a mother that is a Jebusite, an Syriac,

53
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:13,345
a Greek, a Samaritan, an Egyptian Coptic,

54
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:16,375
a Persian, an Assyrian, a Bablyonic,

55
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,700
a Moabian, an Edomite, a Nabatian,

56
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,905
a Hebrew that maybe got Christianized, or became a Muslim, or never did,

57
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:23,500
all are Palestinians!

58
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:27,635
Why would Theodore Hertzl that is born in Budapest, Austria,

59
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:30,655
or David Ben Gurion born in Płońsk, Poland

60
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:34,800
or the Daughter of the president of the United States that converted to Judaism almost two hours ago

61
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,055
are more entitled to than that Arab Palestinian with his mothers' history and their forefathers?

62
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:43,005
I say that the Arab speaking people of the country today

63
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:47,000
Are more entitled of the European Zionist movement with all of history of Palestine;

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,605
Of all its components; Pagan, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim

65
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:55,045
exactly as Roman history is part of the Italians'.

66
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:57,985
Even if their religion or language changed. Even if their Italian race mixed

67
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,900
with Germans, Normans, Greeks, and Arabs

68
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,465
Otherwise, a Catholic Italian today would be

69
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:10,075
alien to the history of Rome because Ceaser was not Christian nor spoke Italian!

70
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,845
The claim of the founder of the Zionist Movement,

71
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:15,845
or the first prime minister of Israel, or the daughter of the American president,

72
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:21,500
that they are more entitled in any part of  ancient Palestine's history than me

73
00:04:22,115 --> 00:04:24,935
is almost like if a foreigner who believes in ancient Egyptian religion;

74
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:27,765
the religion of Amon and Osiris, that he

75
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:30,835
is more entitled to the Pharaonic history of Egypt from today's people of Egypt!

76
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:33,405
Because their religion and language have changed!

77
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:36,545
Then goes to establish a country in Egypt and expels its own people

78
00:04:36,555 --> 00:04:39,705
Muslims and Christians then forbids them to return!

79
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:42,445
The Zionist argument is contradictory.

80
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:45,225
From one side, it is purely religious

81
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:48,335
because it entitles the ownership of the land

82
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,500
to the Jews exclusively and

83
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,525
not those who were there before them, with them, after them, or were originally from them!

84
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:57,385
then changed their religion. From another side,

85
00:04:57,385 --> 00:05:00,295
it claims that it is a secular nationalist movement

86
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:03,055
and that Jews are an ethnicity

87
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:05,815
not a religion either if

88
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:07,805
its own people believed in the faith or not

89
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,945
I do not do a lot of direct political content on those episodes

90
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:14,705
but because we are in times

91
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:17,505
where strong people want to impose upon us

92
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:20,575
the cession upon the cession of our country.

93
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:23,575
I register that the right of each one of us in the country

94
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:26,795
is a personal right. For him, and his offspring afterwards

95
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:29,895
I am one of the people who

96
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:33,095
did not, at all, authorize anyone to cede

97
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:36,355
or even to negotiate using my name on my right and the rights of

98
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:39,295
my offspring after me in this country

99
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:42,345
and each agreement that was signed or getting signed with my name does not

100
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:45,600
abide me nor abides me or my offspring after me to anything.

101
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,155
and whoever signs it does not represent me

102
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,325
We did not expel anyone from his country

103
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:52,895
and we do not want to expel anyone

104
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:56,115
However, we do not accept that someone else expels us

105
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:58,065
then asks us to agree to that.

106
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:01,575
This argument is eternal as the day and the night

107
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:04,495
The same history teaches us that

108
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:08,525
power, no matter how much it allured its holder and scared its victims

109
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:11,200
is vanishing away, definitely!
