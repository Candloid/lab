00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's becoming hard to sleep.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I gotta secret haunting me.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's impossible to keep.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What I've I done or could I do
would tell myself to tell you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
on my hiding place?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Stashed... faraway.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.500
If I got walls that're made of bricks,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.000
I am locked up to see you good.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.500
Cause,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you keep it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If it's become a risk,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
what I've I done or could I do
would tell myself to breath through

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
on my hiding place?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Stashed... faraway.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If I got walls that're made of bricks,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I am locked up see you good.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Cause,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.000
you keep it.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
When I'm keeping a secret and it is taking me

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to far off place no body comes to see.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
When your holy thing
that's hovering out of me

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.000
is deafening silence and secrecy.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
When I'm deep in a secret
and it's killing me,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.000
and my punctured hole that
leads nose how to leak,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.000
and my heart is howling but never speaks.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.000
How could you even know me,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.500
from my hiding place?
