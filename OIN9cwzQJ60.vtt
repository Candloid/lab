00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Today,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,946
The 15th of May of 2021

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:10,715
The war has broke, or this round of it,

4
00:00:11,462 --> 00:00:15,000
while I am in a personal state of mourning that you all know. [Translator: the pass away of his famous poet father Mourid Al-Barghouti]

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,932
I have become one of the most induced with abstaining from life,

6
00:00:17,932 --> 00:00:21,386
craving to stay away, very knowledgeable of the meaning of loss,

7
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:24,368
and one of the most aware of the fact that an advisor or a doctor 

8
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:27,645
if he acted in ignorance or if he failed, then he has committed a crime.

9
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:30,306
Because he exposes people to the risk of his opinion,

10
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:31,913
while he is safe from its consequences.

11
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:37,272
Accordingly, I do not say what I say in a passing moment of fervor 

12
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:39,900
in a clash that is not the first, nor will be the last.

13
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:42,941
I am aware of the heaviness of what I will say

14
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:47,711
I even dare to say it, specifically, because I am aware of its heaviness.

15
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:50,748
My say is heavy because it has blood within.

16
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:53,711
Precious and prestige is the blood!

17
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:58,010
And I hold the responsibility of my say today and tomorrow,

18
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,994
alive and dead, it is even a testimony and a bequest.

19
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:05,000
Who wills, shall he remember it for me.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,627
Oh, people!

21
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:12,163
The liberation of Palestine, all of it, from the sea to the river,

22
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:16,466
objectively and realistically, possible.

23
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:21,835
I do not say it is easy. I do not say it is inevitable. I say possible.

24
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:23,835
It is possible in this generation.

25
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:27,885
It is possible, not from armies that buy its weapons from their enemy,

26
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:32,423
but rather in a popular resistance that is continuous and accumulative

27
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:34,423
like the one happening in front of you now.

28
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:38,370
Bare patience with me for a few minutes to clarify how.

29
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,387
There is an apartheid regime in Israel that segregates people based on religion.

30
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:48,579
It is the only country on the face of the earth that grants citizenship based on the inherited religion.

31
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:54,739
If you would go to a Pakistani airport and tell them that you are a Muslim, they would not grant you a passport.

32
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:59,765
If you would go to an Indian airport and tell them that you are a Hindu, they would not grant you a passport.

33
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:03,168
However, it should be enough for you to be Jewish or your mother to be Jewish

34
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:07,506
to go to Ben Gurion airport and become an Israeli citizen.

35
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:12,781
You can live in a house whose people were expelled out of it or a land that was stolen from its owners.

36
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:18,132
This regime is the reason why the Palestinians are either displaced or martyrs.

37
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:23,462
Not for anything else but because they have been born in this land and because the religion of their mothers

38
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:27,898
does not come to the liking of a teenage officer whose family came from East Europe recently.

39
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:32,913
This racist regime rules over the lives of all of the Palestinians

40
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:34,774
inside of Palestine and outside of it.

41
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:40,000
Toppling this regime means the liberation of all of Palestine, from sea to river,

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,135
and the liberation of all of the Palestinians, wherever they were in this world.

43
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:50,693
A comprehensive confrontation between the two demographical blocs in historical Palestine;

44
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:56,151
the people of the land and their invaders, is sufficient to topple this regime.

45
00:02:56,151 --> 00:03:02,478
This confrontation could have been civil like many anti-apartheid movements in a lot of countries

46
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:05,967
if the rulers of Israel were wise and farsighted.

47
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:11,423
However, it is taking the form of continuously-increasing violent confrontations 

48
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:14,581
that is expanding, just like the one happening now,

49
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:21,257
 because the rulers of Israel are still narrow-sighted and conceited. [Superior] arms do conceit!

50
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:29,893
The count of Palestinians between the sea and the river exceeds the count of Jews holding Israeli citizenship

51
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:37,669
in more than 166,000 people today, according to two official censuses: an Israeli and a Palestinian.

52
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:42,832
The difference is projected at a rise to the benefit of the Palestinians in the upcoming couple of decades.

53
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:46,308
The confrontation does not happen against the entirety of the [Jewish] bloc

54
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:53,294
but rather with the bloc that supports the apartheid which is necessarily lesser.

55
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:59,875
Palestinians are younger and less wealthy making them more dangerous.

56
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:08,249
Israel tried to treat that by doing two things: by dividing them then concentrating them in isolated cantons, firstly.

57
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:11,139
And in inciting some of them against the others, secondly.

58
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:15,693
It divided them into West Bankers, Gazans, and Jerusalem-ers and Insiders [of Israel].

59
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:19,873
Then divided the West Bank into Areas A, B, and C

60
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:25,743
then separated the West Bank cities from each other, then tried to contain the Palestinians using Palestinians

61
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:30,258
through agreements of peace, security coordination, and economical dependency.

62
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:34,203
With every new confrontation, those divisions dissolve.

63
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:40,000
There you see Gaza supporting Jerusalem, while Lod, Galilee, and the West Bank are supporting Gaza.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,916
Lod has even, almost, liberate itself autonomously.

65
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:48,108
And so, every new confrontation, not only embarrasses the occupation alone, 

66
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:51,110
but also every authority that makes peace with it.

67
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,098
The people are not in a state of peace. If any authority decided to go to peace,

68
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,727
it would not rule over but its employees.

69
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:04,379
While the Arab armies buy their arms from those who arm Israel,

70
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,915
the Palestinians do not buy the rocks nor the rockets. They rather invent them!

71
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:13,318
The independence of the arms is a requirement for the dependency of the nation.

72
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:16,536
There is no way that you would liberate a land with a restricted weapon.

73
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:21,326
While some Arab government are blockading the Palestinian resistance,

74
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:25,762
You can clearly see that it is capable of developing its own arms despite the blockade.

75
00:05:25,762 --> 00:05:31,308
The comprehensive confrontation between two intermingling demographic blocs

76
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:36,692
like the Palestinians and their invaders, deprives Israel of its two military advantages:

77
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:39,730
the Air Force and the unconventional weaponry.

78
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:48,654
If Israel can strike Gaza, it cannot strike Jerusalem, Lod, Jaffa, Haifa, or Galilee where the two blocs mix.

79
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:54,190
It will have to use the police, then their counts would not be enough, then it would need the army.

80
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,153
The more it supports a front, the other weakens.

81
00:05:57,153 --> 00:06:05,204
Even in Gaza, Israel was not able to strike it until it evacuated its settlers out of it.

82
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:12,509
It stroke it in 2008, 2012, 2014 and did not change a thing.

83
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:19,774
Even if it [Israel] has decided to reoccupy it, as it did before for 40 years, the resistance grew despite the occupation.

84
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:28,559
The accumulation of confrontation its variations would pose pressure on the racist regime until it changes.

85
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:37,750
This means that the country cannot be ruled with half of its population not ceding to its rulers,

86
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,750
but rather disobeying them in every means.

87
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,461
From drawing on the walls, through strikes, through demonstrations, to war.

88
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:48,171
Despite all of that, they increase in numbers every year, but rather every hour.

89
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:53,836
The country that its founders wanted to be a safe haven is no more so.

90
00:06:53,836 --> 00:07:00,550
Nobody wants to emigrate to it anymore since where they are is safer than emigrating to it.

91
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,318
Injustice is as much of a hazard for the oppressor compared to the oppressed.

92
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:11,783
Again, we wish we get our rights without violence to which we are its main victims.

93
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:15,455
However, if the military airplanes imposed death on us, 

94
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,320
in a full confrontation of a series of them,

95
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,740
We must whisper in the ears of our murderers that the painful defacto of the region

96
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,892
that shows a war between a regular army and emerging popular resistances,

97
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:36,214
or a civil war between two blocs, of a great destructive capacity that exceeds classic wars

98
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:43,680
If everybody loses in this kind of war, then that who has more loses more.

99
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,031
Here, the strong would lose if he does not win,

100
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,817
and the weak wins if he does not lose.

101
00:07:49,817 --> 00:08:03,435
We must remind the pilot conceiting to strike us that Israel never won a decisive victory in any battle since 1967.

102
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:12,193
It did not win the War of Attrition in 1968, nor the 1973 war, and when it invaded Lebanon in 1978 it got out of it later, 

103
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:16,026
and when it invaded it in 1983 under the pretext of securing Galilee.

104
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:24,678
It did not do much other than replacing the Palestinian arms with Lebanese that exceeds Galilee all the way to the Negev.

105
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:30,612
It has failed in its campaigns on Lebanon in 1993, 1996, and 2006.

106
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:37,800
And on Gaza in 2008, 2012, 2014, and here it fails today.

107
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:46,420
If you think about it, Israel in 55 years, did not grab land but from those who made peace with it,

108
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:52,865
where [illegal] settling in West Bank tripled after signing the Oslo Accord.

109
00:08:52,865 --> 00:09:00,106
Israel has made a laughing stock and set a bad example from those who cooperated with it and made peace with it,

110
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:04,032
and made resisting it an inevitable necessity.

111
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:07,201
Accordingly, it is possible to say that yesterday and today,

112
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:16,097
resistance, in its abstract concept, is the one and only representative of the Palestinian people.

113
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:24,169
I say liberation is possible. It is possible in this generation, but it is not inevitable.

114
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:28,500
Gets closer by the resistance and further by bargaining [for the rights], treachery,

115
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:34,416
and [relationship] normalization [with Israel], dictatorships, and sectarian wars in our region.

116
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:42,735
Let it be known to every supporter of the dictators and normalizers that he is just as a fighter in the Israeli Army;

117
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:49,688
elongating the invasion and shortening the lives of our beloved ones. However, that is another story.

118
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:56,187
This talk will not be significant after some years once the country and the people get liberated.

119
00:09:56,187 --> 00:10:00,702
Once that day comes, remember the songs and forget about the politics, 

120
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:07,071
Wars come and go, how many times did a country get invaded, then liberated, then forgot about its invasion and occupation?

121
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:13,648
However, now, when [you see] the teenager solid forces millions to live under tin ceilings,  

122
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:18,737
or to force them to cry their loved ones, just because he does not like their religion or the color of their eyes,

123
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:23,105
then it is an ugly thing and you do not have to one of its victims to realize how ugly it is.

124
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:29,129
So remember this talk and whenever someone tells you that the resistance is futile,

125
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:34,544
tell him that the past and the present testify that it is the injustice that is futile. 

126
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:40,395
I know that patience is bitter. Today, I am one of the most who knows how bitter it is.

127
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:49,189
However, be patient and you shall receive. You are not the first to be patient and receive and not the first to resist and win.
